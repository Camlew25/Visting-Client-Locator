I want to find out all the visiting sports teams coming in to a city on a given date and time


For this project, I am going to examine all the Professional schedules ( NBA, NHL, NFL, CFL, MLS, MLB, etc) and college schedules (NCAA D1, D2, D3, NAIA, etc) and create a program that can analyze what visiting teams are coming into a city during a certain time period within the necessary restictions ( distance, travel time, etc.)

I will be using the Google Maps API, Google Earth API, Lists of NCAA Schools from Wiki, Google Spreedsheets, etc to complete this project.
